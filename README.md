Phi is a modular discord bot coded in JavaScript. The Development plugin allows for easier control of the bot and parent system by a bot administrator.

* *DISCLAIMER: Only use this plugin if you know what you are doing.*

## Commands

* `neofetch`: Gives the administrator information on the instance of Phi which is running.

## Configuration

In order for the plugin to function, a `config.json` file must be created. The following is an example of a `config.json` where all sensitive information has been left out:  

```json
{
    "id": ""
}
```

* `id`: The Discord ID of Phi's administrator.

## Usage

* Place the plugin folder into the `./plugins` directory of Phi's main directory.

## Todo

* CLI input for the administrator (any commands are auto authorized)
